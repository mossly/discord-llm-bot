Opens a thread in which a ttrpg style game unfolds. This is similar to roleplaying services like SillyTavern https://github.com/SillyTavern/SillyTavern or Character AI https://character.ai/ except that the LLM has access to a variety of tools to manage the RP session. You see, LLMs excel at flavour text and character dialouge, but are lacklustre at game mechanics and reliably managing a world state. Therefore the LLM should play the role of a game master, with the mechanics handled by external systems like game rules, dice rolling, a character sheet, bestiary, etc.

### Dice rolls
A tool to roll an n sided dice (generate a random number out of n)

### World State

### Character Sheet
A database with player character statistics and information

### Bestiary
A database with monster statistics and information
